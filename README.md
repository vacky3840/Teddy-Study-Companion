## Setup Instructions

1. **Install the Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website.

2. **Add Required Libraries:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`.
   - Search for and install any libraries required by the `TEDDY.ino` file (e.g., LiquidCrystal, UniversalTelegramBot.h).

## Running the Program

1. **Open `TEDDY.ino`:**
   - Launch the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the `TEDDY.ino` file from the project folder.

2. **Upload the Code:**
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Select the correct board and port under `Tools > Board` and `Tools > Port` in the Arduino IDE.
   - Click the `Upload` button to upload the code to the Arduino board.

3. **Power On:**
   - Once the upload is complete, disconnect the USB cable and power the Arduino board using an external power source (if required).
   - The robotic teddy bear should now be operational.
